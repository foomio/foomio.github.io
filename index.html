      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>When I was 15, I embarked on my coding journey by creating web pages with HTML/CSS. 
        Encouraged by my dad, I explored computer science classes in high school, approaching them with dedication. 
        While learning Java, I found joy in the challenging coding assignments, solidifying my decision to major in Computer Science. 
        Fast forward to todayâ€”I proudly hold a B.A. in Computer Science from Texas State University and boast nearly 2 years of professional software engineering experience. 
        Let'sconnect and explore how my skills can contribute to your next project or opportunity!
